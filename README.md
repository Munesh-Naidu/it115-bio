Hello my name is Munesh. I am currently an emerging professional in the Seattle tech industry. I live in Kent which is a city outside of Seattle in 
Washington. Since I was kid I've played video games, from Pokemon to Call of Duty to Elden Ring. This is what sparked my passion to be in the tech industry.
I want tobe able to see, understand and write code that goes into any of those games. I have slowly learned different types of code, I already kno C+, 
Python and some of Jave while currently learning HTML.
