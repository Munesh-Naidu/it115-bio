<h1>Munesh Naidu</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Munesh. I am currently an emerging professional in the tech industry. I live in which is a city outside of Seattle in Washington.
Since I was kid I've played video games, from Pokemon to Call of Duty to Elden Ring. This is what sparked my passion to be in the tech industry. I want to
be able to see, understand and write code that goes into any of those games. I have slowly learned different types of code, I already kno C+, Python 
and some of Jave while currently learning HTML.</p>
