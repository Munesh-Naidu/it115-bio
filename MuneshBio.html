<h1>Munesh Naidu</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Munesh. I am currently an emerging professional in the tech industry. I live in which is a city outside of Seattle in Washington.
Since I was kid I've played video games, from Pokemon to Call of Duty to Elden Ring. This is what sparked my passion to be in the tech industry. I want to
be able to see, understand and write code that goes into any of those games. With the support from my family, friends, and profressors I beleive I can reach
that goal.</p>
